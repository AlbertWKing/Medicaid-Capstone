    "## Notebook 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Drug shortages directly contribute to preventable deaths, drug stockpiling and rationing by hospitals and governments, and inflated drug costs. In effort to characterize the situation of current drug shortages, this project looks at reported US Medicaid drug claims by states for years 1991-2022, the most recent data currently available. In combination with the FDA's current list of shortages and anticipated shortages, time series analysis is used to forecast future demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is divided into 4 Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook 1 imports Medicaid data into a MySQL database, explores and cleans prescription data, and prepares a list of drugs common to the Medicaid data and current FDA shortages.\n",
    "- Notebook 2 explores and models the prescription data aggregated to total prescriptions per year nationwide. Fitting is accomplished through ARIMA and Facebook Prophet models.\n",
    "- Notebook 3 models the data using an ARIMA multiple-point output convolutional neural network (CNN). It is separate due incompatabilities between the environments used for Notebooks 1, 2, and 4 with TensorFlow/Keras.\n",
    "- Notebook 4 ingests, cleans, models, and forecasts prescription demand for individual drugs en masse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medicaid datasets were downloaded locally as CSV files from https://data.medicaid.gov/datasets?theme%5B0%5D=State+Drug+Utilization for all years available. The CSV files were brought into MySQL initially using command line as MySQLWorkbench was not able to handle the size of the files. This method is recreated below so as to aggregate methods into Jupyter notebooks, though the initial command line code is included in an appendix. Current drug shortages were downloaded from https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/drugshortages/default.cfm as CSV files.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Bulk Fitting and Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook digests prescription data en masse. Generally, several functions are written which serve to collect data for each specified drug; clean the data by removing extremely high values and forward filling any empty values; fitting the data to optimize ARIMA parameters; averaging the top 5 fits; and forecasting (unsupervised) future prescriptions for each drug.\n",

    "131 drugs present in the Medicaid data and the shortage list have been forecast to the third quarter of 2023. The modeling will be improved in the future to be more robust in dealing with data where th drug is new to the Medicaid data set, and a full history is not available. A slight downward trend is expected in prescriptions overall, from 95.4 million in the final quarter of 2022 to 93.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The SMAPE is shown for each prediction, and the mean SMAPE for all drugs is 6.4%. The lowest SMAPE is 0.03%, and 74% of forecasts have a SMAPE less than or equal to 4.8%. This suggests high validity of the forecasts."
